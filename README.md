### Hi there, I'm Viktor ðŸ‘‹

I work on [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet) as a developer at Microsoft based in Vienna, Austria. I initially joined Microsoft Austria in 2016 as an ATS (Account Technology Strategist) but shortly after realized that I belong into Engineering after all. These days I mostly focus on improving the Infrastructure of the core stack repositories like [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime).
